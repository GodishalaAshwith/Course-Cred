3. SYSTEM DESIGN

3.1. Architecture Overview
The Course-Cred platform implements a modern, scalable architecture designed to handle educational video processing, content verification, and credit distribution. The system follows a microservices-inspired approach while maintaining practical integration boundaries for development efficiency.

At its core, Course-Cred employs a multi-tier architecture:
1. Client Tier: A React-based single-page application built with Vite, providing responsive interfaces and smooth user experiences using TailwindCSS.
2. Application Tier: 
   - Express.js API server handling business logic, authentication, and coordination
   - Python-based analysis service for video processing and AI-powered content analysis
3. Data Tier: MongoDB database for persistent storage of user, video, and transaction information
4. Security Layer: JWT-based authentication, bcrypt password hashing, and role-based access control

This architecture provides several advantages:
- Clear separation of concerns between frontend, backend logic, and data persistence
- Specialized technology selection (React/Vite for UI, Express for API, Python for AI)
- Scalability through component isolation
- Comprehensive security through layered access control

3.2. Frontend Design
The Course-Cred frontend employs a modern React-based architecture using Vite for optimal performance. Key aspects include:

1. Component Organization:
   - Page Components (Home, Dashboard, Admin, Videos)
   - Feature Components (VideoPlayer, AdminDashboard, ComplaintsTable)
   - UI Components (Navbar, ConfirmDialog)
   - Layout Components (structural elements)

2. State Management:
   - Local state for UI components
   - Context API for authentication state
   - API integration through Axios with interceptors

3. Key Features:
   - Responsive design with TailwindCSS
   - AOS (Animate On Scroll) for smooth animations
   - Protected routing with role-based access
   - Real-time video processing feedback

3.3. Backend Design
The Course-Cred backend implements a structured API design with two main services:

1. Express.js API Server:
   - RESTful endpoints with clear resource boundaries
   - Middleware layers for auth, validation, and error handling
   - Route organization by domain (auth, videos, admin, complaints)
   - File handling with secure storage and access control

2. Python Analysis Service:
   - Video processing and frame extraction
   - AI-powered content analysis
   - Uniqueness detection
   - Credit calculation based on content quality

3.4. Database Schema
Course-Cred utilizes MongoDB with the following core collections:

1. Users Collection:
   - Authentication details (email, hashed password)
   - Profile information (name, credits)
   - Role information (isAdmin)
   - Video purchase history
   - Transaction tracking

2. Videos Collection:
   - Content metadata (title, description)
   - File information and storage paths
   - Analysis results (fingerprint, uniqueness score)
   - Credit allocation
   - Owner reference

3. Transactions Collection:
   - Buyer and seller references
   - Video reference
   - Credit amount
   - Transaction status
   - Timestamps

4. Complaints Collection:

   - Secure password hashing with bcrypt
   - Admin access code system
   - Token refresh mechanism

2. Authorization:
   - Role-based access control
   - Protected routes
